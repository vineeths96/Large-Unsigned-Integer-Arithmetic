<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This program performs the arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication) on large integers represented by singly linked lists. The entire program is written in three files - `client.c`, `header.c`, and `implement.c`. Comments have been added frequently to help in understanding the logic behind implementation. The maximum number of operands and the size of the input string expression has been limited to 5 and 100 respectively. They can be modified by varying `OPMAX`  and `SMAX` values in `header.c` file, if required. This program repeats indefinitely till exited manually. Refer [Problem statement](./Problem-Statement.pdf) file for detailed information.

### Built With
This project was built with 

* C
* Ubuntu 18.04.1 
* gcc version 7.4.0



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into a local machine using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vineeths96/Large-unsigned-interger-arithmetic
```

### Instructions to run

Open the terminal, make the program and run it. 

```shell
make
./a.out
```

Enter the values from the file (or custom values) as requested during exectuion of the program.

### Testcases

The [testcase.txt](./testcase.txt) contains the 5 test cases. Comments have been added to guide through the test case file to identify where to input data.
